# United States Aviation Administrator (USAA) Backend API

A Cloudflare Workers-based backend API for the United States Aviation Administrator (USAA) system. This API tracks and manages aviation pilot data including departure airport, arrival airport, CID, callsign, airline ID, and aircraft type for comprehensive flight network monitoring.

## Features

- Track aviation pilot online/offline status
- Store pilot flight information with departure/arrival airports
- Track airline ID and aircraft type for each flight
- Map callsigns to pilot CIDs for USAA network
- RESTful API with JSON responses
- CORS support for web applications
- Deployable to Cloudflare Workers or Pages
- Uses Cloudflare KV for data persistence
- Designed for United States Aviation Administrator operations

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Cloudflare account
- Wrangler CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure Cloudflare KV namespace:
```bash
# Create KV namespace
wrangler kv:namespace create "USAA_PILOTS"
wrangler kv:namespace create "USAA_PILOTS" --preview

# Update wrangler.toml with the namespace IDs returned from above commands
```

3. Update `wrangler.toml` with your KV namespace IDs.

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Environment Variables

Configure these in your `wrangler.toml` or Cloudflare dashboard:
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Set to "production" for production deployment

## Data Storage

The API uses Cloudflare KV for data persistence with the following key patterns:

- `pilot:{cid}` - Stores pilot data
- `callsign:{CALLSIGN}` - Maps callsigns to CIDs

**KV Namespace:** `USAA_PILOTS`

## Pilot Data Structure

Each pilot record contains the following fields:
- `cid` - Pilot ID (numeric string)
- `callsign` - Aircraft callsign (uppercase)
- `departureAirport` - ICAO code for departure airport (e.g., "KLAX")
- `arrivalAirport` - ICAO code for arrival airport (e.g., "KJFK")
- `airlineId` - Airline identifier code (e.g., "UAL", "AAL")
- `aircraftType` - Aircraft type code (e.g., "B737", "A320")
- `status` - "online" or "offline"
- `onlineTime` - ISO timestamp when pilot came online
- `lastUpdate` - ISO timestamp of last update
- `firstSeen` - ISO timestamp when pilot was first tracked
- `offlineTime` - ISO timestamp when pilot went offline (if applicable)

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error description",
  "details": "Additional error details (in development)"
}
```

## CORS Support

The API includes CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests from web applications.
